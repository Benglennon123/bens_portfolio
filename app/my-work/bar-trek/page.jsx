            Bar-Trek is my brainchild - a collaborative project with my dad and
            three friends launched in June 2024. We've built the ultimate
            platform for pub discovery, tracking, and planning epic pub crawls
            across the UK.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Origin Story</h2>
          <p>
            The genesis of Bar-Trek is a tale of family, tradition, and a touch
            of humor. It all started with my dad, John, a true connoisseur of
            Liverpool's vibrant pub scene. His method of tracking pub visits was
            hilariously old-school: a poster of Liverpool adorned with a sea of
            green and red dots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Green dots marked the pubs he'd conquered, while red dots
            represented the unexplored territories awaiting his visit. It was a
            visual representation of his liquid journey through the city â€“ a
            journey he was eager to share with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I caught him in the act of building this and said, "What are you
            doing! It would take me 2 hours to build a map from the spreadsheet
            to visualize all this for you." That casual observation would be the
            spark that ignited Bar-Trek's creation.

            Technical Details
          </h2>
          <p>
            Technically speaking, I built the whole site using Next.js and
            Supabase. What started as a digital version of my dad's quirky
            poster quickly evolved as we recognized a greater opportunity: why
            stop at tracking pubs when we could revolutionize the entire pub
            crawl experience?
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Vision</h2>
          <p>
            As we delved deeper into development, our vision expanded. We're not
            just creating an app; we're building a community platform for pub
            enthusiasts. Our goal is to make Bar-Trek the go-to resource for
            discovering, planning, and sharing unforgettable pub crawls across
            the UK.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're passionate about preserving the social essence of pub culture
            while enhancing it with modern technology. Whether you're a local
            looking to explore your city's hidden gems or a tourist seeking the
            perfect pub route, Bar-Trek is designed with you in mind.

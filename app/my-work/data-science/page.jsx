            My journey at bp began in 2020 when I joined as a data science
            degree apprentice. Right from the start, I was thrown into the deep
            end, becoming the sole data scientist in my team within the wells
            division. Looking back, this was actually a blessing in disguise. It
            forced me to really understand how to interact with my customers and
            keep their needs front and center - something I'll admit I briefly
            lost sight of later in my bp career.

            Then came a massive opportunity - leading the Data and Analytics
            Community of Practice at bp. This was huge. Suddenly, I had access
            to this incredible network of data specialists, which gave me a much
            broader perspective on how my work fit into the bigger picture. It
            also constantly challenged me to focus on the most impactful
            projects.

            The Hackathon was such a hit that I wanted to find a way to scale
